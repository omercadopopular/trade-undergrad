# International Trade Theory and Policy

**ECON 2181 - Undergraduate Trade Course**  
**George Washington University**

This repository contains the complete course materials for an undergraduate course in International Trade Theory and Policy taught at George Washington University (GWU).

## Course Description

This course studies the foundations of international trade and policy, covering:

- Classical and neoclassical theories of comparative advantage
- The specific-factors and Heckscher–Ohlin models
- Firm heterogeneity and intra-industry trade
- Trade policies under perfect and imperfect competition
- Contemporary topics linking theory to real-world applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the semester, students should be able to:

1. **Comprehend and explain** the modern trade theories and their assumptions
2. **Illustrate** each theory using standard analytical tools (e.g., PPFs, GE diagrams, gravity) and data
3. **Solve** for the equilibrium of different models, using pen-and-paper as well as a computer
4. **Interpret policy implications** and distributional effects of trade and trade policy
